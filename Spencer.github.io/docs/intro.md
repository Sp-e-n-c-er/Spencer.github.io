## Introduction

Keeping Dell systems up-to-date with the latest drivers and firmware is a critical task for IT professionals and Managed Service Providers (MSPs). Manually updating each device is time-consuming and prone to error, especially across large fleets. Fortunately, tools like Dell Command Update (DCU) and NinjaOne, a powerful Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) platform, can streamline this process through automation.

In this post, we’ll explore how to leverage PowerShell scripts from the [Public-Ninja-One-Scripts repository](https://github.com/Sp-e-n-c-er/Public-Ninja-One-Scripts/tree/main/Dell%20Command%20Update) to automate DCU deployments and updates within NinjaOne. Whether you're onboarding new devices or maintaining an existing infrastructure, this guide will help you save time and ensure consistency.

## Why Automate Dell Command Update?

Dell Command Update simplifies driver and firmware management by providing a single tool to check, download, and install updates tailored to each Dell device. Pairing it with NinjaOne’s scripting capabilities takes this a step further by:

- **Reducing Manual Effort**: Automate repetitive tasks across multiple endpoints.
- **Ensuring Consistency**: Apply uniform update policies fleet-wide.
- **Improving Efficiency**: Schedule updates to run silently in the background.

The scripts from the Public-Ninja-One-Scripts repository provide a ready-made solution to deploy DCU, configure it, and apply updates—all integrated with NinjaOne.

## Getting Started with the Scripts

The [Dell Command Update folder](https://github.com/Sp-e-n-c-er/Public-Ninja-One-Scripts/tree/main/Dell%20Command%20Update) in the repository contains several PowerShell scripts designed for NinjaOne. Here’s a breakdown of the key scripts:

1. **`Install-DellCommandUpdate.ps1`**
   - Downloads and installs the latest version of DCU silently.
   - Ideal for onboarding new devices or ensuring DCU is present on all systems.

2. **`Configure-DellCommandUpdate.ps1`**
   - Customizes DCU settings via an XML configuration file.
   - Allows you to specify update types (e.g., drivers, firmware) and schedules.

3. **`Run-DellCommandUpdate.ps1`**
   - Executes DCU to check for and install updates based on your configuration.
   - Can be scheduled in NinjaOne for regular maintenance.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:
- NinjaOne RMM is deployed on your target devices.
- PowerShell execution policy allows script execution (`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`).
- Administrative access to the endpoints.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Import Scripts into NinjaOne
- Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
- In the NinjaOne console, navigate to **Administration > Scripts**.
- Upload each `.ps1` file as a new script, assigning appropriate names and categories.

### 2. Deploy DCU to Endpoints
- Create a policy or run the `Install-DellCommandUpdate.ps1` script on demand.
- The script downloads DCU from Dell’s official site and installs it silently with the `/s` flag.

### 3. Configure DCU Settings
- Modify the XML configuration in `Configure-DellCommandUpdate.ps1` to suit your needs (e.g., exclude BIOS updates for testing).
- Run the script to apply the configuration across your fleet.

### 4. Schedule Updates
- Use `Run-DellCommandUpdate.ps1` in a NinjaOne scheduled task to check for updates weekly or monthly.
- Optionally, add logic to prompt users for reboots if required.

## Customization Tips

- **Filter Updates**: Adjust the XML to include only critical drivers or exclude firmware for manual review.
- **Error Handling**: Add try-catch blocks to log failures in NinjaOne for troubleshooting.
- **Reporting**: Integrate NinjaOne’s custom fields to track update status per device.

## Conclusion

Automating Dell Command Update with NinjaOne transforms a tedious chore into a seamless process. The scripts from the Public-Ninja-One-Scripts repository provide a solid foundation, and with a bit of customization, you can tailor them to your organization’s needs. Start small, test on a few devices, and scale up as you gain confidence.
