Contact your admin for assistance.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n$AdminStatus = Ninja-Property-Get $AdminStatusFieldName\\r\\nif ($AdminStatus -ne 1) {\\r\\n    $Session = Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem | Select-Object -ExpandProperty UserName\\r\\n    if ($Session) {\\r\\n        $Username = $Session.Split(\'\\\\\')[1]\\r\\n        Invoke-Expression \\"msg $($Username) /TIME:30 \'$MessageTitle - $MessageBody\'\\"\\r\\n        Write-Output \\"Message sent to $($Username): Admin access required.\\"\\r\\n    } else {\\r\\n        Write-Output \\"No active user session detected to notify.\\"\\r\\n    }\\r\\n} else {\\r\\n    ## Insert Script to run here!\\r\\n    Write-Output \\"Admin access granted. Running admin script.\\"\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Safeguarding the Admin Restriction\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent the `AdminStatus` field from being left enabled accidentally, set up an automated process to enforce its restricted state. \\r\\nDepending on your preferences, configure this as an automation policy or a scheduled task. \\r\\nExecute the following script hourly to automatically disable the field if it\u2019s been overlooked:\\r\\n\\r\\n```powershell\\r\\n$AdminStatusFieldName = \\"AdminStatus\\"\\r\\n$AdminStatus = Ninja-Property-Get $AdminStatusFieldName\\r\\nif ($AdminStatus -ne 0) {\\r\\n    Ninja-Property-Set $AdminStatusFieldName 0\\r\\n    Write-Output \\"AdminStatus has been successfully disabled.\\"\\r\\n}\\r\\nelse {\\r\\n    Write-Output \\"AdminStatus is already in a disabled state.\\"\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n## Configuring the System Tray for Admin-Only Scripts\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, let\u2019s configure the NinjaOne system tray to clearly distinguish and organize scripts reserved for admin use. This setup ensures they\u2019re both easily recognizable and securely managed.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Steps:\\r\\n1. Go to **Administration > Branding > Systray** in the NinjaOne interface.\\r\\n2. Either create a new system tray configuration or edit an existing one.\\r\\n3. Add the following elements to structure your admin-only scripts:\\r\\n\\r\\n| Menu Item Type    | Details                     |\\r\\n|-------------------|-----------------------------|\\r\\n| Separator         | (Creates a visual break)   |\\r\\n| Group             | Label: \\"Admin Only Scripts\\" |\\r\\n| Automation        | Your admin-specific scripts |\\r\\n\\r\\n### Explanation:\\r\\n- **Separator**: Inserts a dividing line in the tray menu to enhance visual separation.\\r\\n- **Group**: Establishes a labeled section titled \\"Admin Only Scripts\\" to categorize restricted scripts.\\r\\n- **Automation**: Nest your admin-only automations (e.g., scripts with the `AdminStatus` check) under the \\"Admin Only Scripts\\" group. This nesting ensures these scripts appear as submenu items beneath the group label, keeping them organized and clearly tied to their admin-only purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis configuration not only isolates admin scripts visually in the system tray but also reinforces their restricted access through the `AdminStatus` check, providing a seamless experience for technicians.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee below for a visual guide on the systray setup, and the message a user will see if they dont have the permissions to run this.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fa5af98-e91d-49a6-b1e8-24e474745bb1\\" alt=\\"Admin Only Scripts System Tray Example\\" width=\\"300\\" /> <img src=\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e9481d7-bfbc-4106-90d4-dc4b03d5a6c7\\" alt=\\"Invalid rights message\\" width=\\"300\\" />"}]}}')}}]);
